# Learning Resources

<br />

Here is a list of resources I have personally used over the years. I have tried to logically compound them
into categories, although this can be difficult as there is some overlap. I have rated the courses as to how
useful I found each of them. This is purely a "usefulness" rating for the topics covered, the explanations
included, and the resources provided in each. This list includes a mixture of video courses, interactive courses, books,
and other reading material. This also considers the quality of the content, how many practical examples are included.
and how worth your money the resource is. Please note I have used a decimal system out of 10 to score these.

I have more resources if you would like specific information for certain topics, however, I have left
these out as there are many resources and this is aimed at more of a general audience interested in
getting into development, rather than specialist materials. I will however list some of the more engaging resources I come across.
